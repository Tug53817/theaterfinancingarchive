        <div class="profiletext"><h3 class="aboutme">ABOUT THIS PROJECT</h3><p> This site is an adapted version of the one I had originally imagined for my final documentation project. However, my original research question was able to remain the same, as I originally intended to discover the processes and documents associated with financing theaters. The reason I chose (and stuck with) this topic is beccause all theaters, not-for-profit, non-profit, and for profit alike, rely on money to hire and pay for their staff, lease, and productions. As a result, the flow of money is crucial for any theater's existance. To find out more about this process, I reached out to Theater Exile, and through e-mails with their management, I was able to get a good idea of the steps involved in the process of financing theater. However, I feel like much was left unsaid because of the inherent inefficiencies of communicating electronically, as well as the social predicament we all find ourselves in.   </p> 
        <p>Regardless, the method I used to recieve information through email is exacly the same as what I would have done in person, which is to conduct an interview by asking for specific information and documentation regarding theater finances. In doing so, I not only learn about the actual process, but also get insight into the views of those who actually operate in the financial decision making at Theatre Exile. The two people I communicated with were Brey Ann Barrett (who left for maternity leave) and Autumn Valdez, the General Manager, who both filled me in on how money flows in the company. Autumn was also the one who sent me the samples of excel spreadsheets used for internal bookkeeping purposes. Despite learning a lot, I definitely watered down my questioning to reduce the burden I placed on the Theatre Exile staff, so I did not get all the information I wanted. I also did not get to conduct an in person interview, which I had planned to film and embed on this site. Finally, I wanted to view the financial operations of the theater in person, as this would have allowed me to view many more financial documents then I got to see through email, but due to the virus, this became infeasible. The consequence of these shortcomings is that the actual number of documentables I have on this site are quite limited, and had the last few months been "business as usual", I would have definitely liked to attain more.       </p>
        <p>However, since I do have the few documentables in the "DOCUMENTABLES" page, let me quickly walk through what they are and their context in the theater financial process. The first document is Theater Exile's official 501(c)(3) submission to the Internal Revenue Service from 2017, which was sent to me by Brey. This is the last level in the financial process as the form acts as a synopsis of all the transactions that occur in the year, of course used by the government to grant "non-profit" status to the theater. The next two documents are limited examples of Theatre Exile's internal bookkeeping. Both were used to analyze the effects of ticket shares on company profits, with the latter document showing profit projections generated by a theoretical number of ticket sales for a 2018 production of <i>Tommy and Me</i>. These kinds of documents are used all throughout the production process (so from pre- to post-) so that the team within Theater Exile (including the board of directors) can get a solid understanding of where money is going, and how it is (or is going to) coming in. The last document is a formal financial report from Village Theatre in Washington state which features all of the key financial documents that can be used by the company's board, the government, and investors (or sponsors). Documents such as incomes statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements can all be found inside. Although Theatre Exile also produces something similar, I was unable to recieve a copy. This formal report is typically used at the end of a theater's financial process as well, as it gives key financial personnel (especially the board) all the figures needed to judge company performance, and thus the direction the company will need to go in the future. </p>

            I would say that this was a very interesting project, and certainly allowed me to learn about the finances of a world that I had never really dived into. Going to live theater for the first time and seeing <i>Babel</i> was quite memorable, and communicating with the Theatre Exile staff was a pleasure. Although my project did not turn out exactly as I had planned, I was lucky in that most of what I did plan was still doable in a completely virtual world. If you read this far, thank you for another great semester Professor Kaufmann!
