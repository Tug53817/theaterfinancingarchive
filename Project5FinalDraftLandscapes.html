        <img src="96251863-57a250083df78c327615ea44.jpg" alt="Financial Documents" title="Financial Documents" class="top" /> The process of recieving, allocating, and archiving finances for non-profit theaters is just like that of any other small business. The biggest difference is that instead of delivering a physical product in exchange for money, theater companies deliver entertainment in the form of productions. For non-profit theaters such as Theatre Exile, their finances also have to pass an additional level of regulatory scrutiny by the government. The content below specifically outlines the financial process of non-profit theaters, from cash to post-productions.

              <img src="ESmBCwyXsAAqCIC.jpeg" alt="Theater Management" title="Theater Management" class="center" /> <p>First, let's walk through the different levels of financial management in theater companies. If the heirachy of theater finances is thought of as a Hobbesian Leviathan,then the board of directors is its head. The board is a group of individuals that oversees the direction of the theater's overall finances, usually going into the longterm. That is their primary responsibility, ensuring that, when all is said and done, the future vitality of the theater is still in tact. At Theatre Exile, the board of directors consists of eleven members who triennially agree on a three-year budget plan for the company that incorporates production costs and considers operating expenses.  </p>
              
              <p> Under the board of directors is the producing director. Their job is to balance a theater's creative vision with their budgetary constraints. Since the producing director has an instrumental role in the actual production of shows, they have have hands-on knowledge about where money should be allocated in order for a successful show. At Theatre Exile, this role is fulfilled by Deborah Block. 
              
              
              </p>
              
              <p> Serving alongside the producing director are the in-house general managers (GM). The GMs are more of a short-term financial operator. Whereas the board oversees multi-year budgetary decisions, the GMs works closely with the producing director as well as general staff and actors to ensure that the long-term budget is utilized properly on a day-to-day basis (particularly in regards to operating budget). Other responsibilties of the GMs can include general accounting, producing financial reports, and managing staff changes. As a result, much of the documentation regarding theater financing is produced or approved by the GMs. At Theatre Exile, the GMs are Autumn Valdez and Maria Archer.

              Of course, financial decision making at small non-profit theaters like Theatre Exile is a community effort that is affected by the input of many more people than just the board and general managers. However, these two positions yeild the most power in the company's financial decision making. Now, let's look at how theaters raise money, allocate that money for a production, and finally, produce documents associated with the previous steps.

These patrons range from individual theater goers to large corporate entities, and the money recieved can be one-time donations or reoccuring on a set basis. Theaters may also give perks to incentive donations, such as Theatre Exile's name-a-seat program in exchange for donations of $1000 or more. Advertisers may also pay for venue and paybill space, ranging from $200 to $400 a slot. Theatre Exile has also experimented with crowdfunded productions, where an entire production is funded by donations from the general public. In 2016, the theater utilized crowdfunding site Kickstarter to raise over $40,000 to produce <i>Tommy and Me</i>.

            Public and private grants associated with the performing arts (such as those from the McKnight Foundation) are also a source of non-regular funding, ranging from hundreds to thousands of additional dollars that can be put towards productions.    
            </p>      
              
        <p>
            Since Theatre Exile is not considered a not-for-profit instituation, they are free to charge admissions for their productions as well, providing a small but important source of additional revenue typically used to cover operating expenses.

              <img src="ESwqz7YXQAEhfs_.jpg" alt="Babel Production" title="Babel Production" class="center" /> <p>Having raised the money to run the theater and put on productions, this money must be properly allocated so that little is wasted. Aside from overhead costs that are universal to all businesses, theaters also face a unique challenge of having to constantly build new sets and cast new "employees" for productions, dealing with craft unions in the process. The distribution of salaries is one the largest costs faced by theaters, and at Theatre Exile, accounts for about 1/3 of annual expenses. Therefore, theaters must be very sensitive in casting decisions, balancing an actor's intangibles (fitness for a role) with their salary requirments. </p> 
              
              <p>
                Since productions are typically included in a theater's long term budget, most companies have a rough idea as to how much they are able and willing to spend on a set number of shows. At Theatre Exile, the cost of these productions can range from $20,000 to $40,000 depending on the ambitiousness of the set design and the number of actors needed. In order to ensure that a minimal amount of money is misallocated, the producing director and the general manager of theaters must work closely to ensure that every expenditure is used in pursuit of a singular artistic vision for the play, and that money is not wasted through miscommunications.

This is particularly true for non-profit theaters such as Theatre Exile, which must abide by regulatory statutes in order to recieve tax deductible status as a non-profit. This means that although the theater is allowed to earn a profit, these profits must be proven to go directly towards the functioning of the theater. Methods of keeping "the book" or intermediary accounting figures is largely down to what is most familiar to the management, ranging from handwritten notes to more formal spreadsheets and reports. At Theatre Exile for example, many planning documents start as handwritten notes, which when formalized, are entered into electronic bookkeeping programs such as excel or Quikbooks. These electronic documents are then used to synthesize figures for reports presented to the board of directors, or used to complete formal regulatory documents such as the 501(c)(3), which allows organizations to be recognized as income-tax exempt non-profits.
